# Callisto Engine

Calisto engine is being written in C++ with Abstraction and an ECS in mind. 
The original aim is to create the engine in such a way that the rendering can be swapped out between different rendering API's such as OpenGL or D3D11/12. 
Currently, I am focusing on implementing the OpenGL side of things.

## How to use  
### Resources

<summary>Cubemaps</summary>
  
### Cubemaps can be loaded from a config file and its layout is as follows:
```
kright   local location to right image\\right.png
kleft    local location to left image\\left.png
ktop     local location to top image\\top.png
kbottom  local location to bottom image\\bottom.png
kfront   local location to front image\\front.png
kback    local location to back image\\back.png
```
lines marked with # are ignored so they can be used as comments, at least that's what I use. It isn't picky so you could use whatever you wanted or none at all.

<summary>Materials</summary>  
  
 ### Materials files (.mtl)
  In my case, these files are generated by Blender when creating assets. Currently, Callisto doesn't use much of the material file but the two key features are the lines starting with:
```
  -- "map_Bump"
  -- "map_Kd"
```
  map_Bump is used for normal maps and map_Kd is used for diffuse textures.  
  The engine supports loading a texture with a path "map_Kd Resources\\textures\\someImage.png" and just giving it a texture "someImage.png".  
  When passing an image the loader will assume that the texture is located next to the .mtl file, whereas, with the first option, the image can be in a different location than the .mtl file
